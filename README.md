# smart-waste-classification-dl
A deep learning-based waste classification system aimed at improving recycling efficiency by utilizing transfer learning techniques. The project identifies waste categories for proper recycling management through advanced neural networks.


Project Overview
This project, titled Smart Waste Classification Using Deep Learning for Efficient Recycling, aims to develop an intelligent system that accurately classifies waste into recyclable categories. By utilizing transfer learning and deep learning models, this solution intends to aid in the automation of recycling processes, contributing to efficient waste management.

Objectives
Build a waste classification model using deep learning techniques.
Implement transfer learning to enhance the model's performance with minimal training data.
Classify waste images into different categories for more effective recycling.
Dataset
The project uses a publicly available waste classification dataset. The dataset contains images of waste items categorized into classes such as plastic, metal, paper, glass, etc

Dataset Structure
train: Contains images for training the model.
test: Contains images for testing the model.
mapping images to their corresponding waste categories.

Model Architecture
The project leverages transfer learning with a pre-trained model, such as VGG16 or ResNet50, to classify waste images. Transfer learning allows us to fine-tune a model that has been trained on a large dataset (such as ImageNet) to perform well on the waste classification task with fewer images.

Input: Waste image
Output: Predicted waste category (e.g., plastic, metal, paper, etc.)
Key Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes a pre-trained model to reduce training time and improve accuracy.
Image Augmentation: Applies random transformations to the input images to generalize the model better.
